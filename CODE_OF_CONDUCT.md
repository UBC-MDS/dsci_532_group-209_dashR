# Code of Conduct:

We believe all members of our team should abide by the code of conduct to ensure a safe and fun working environment.

## Our Goals:

- Ensure all of us have a positive group experience with an enjoyable and inclusive environment. We will treat each other how we would like to be treated ourselves

- Being open and friendly to assist other team members in need of help

- Respectfully listen to the ideas of others and ensure everyone has an opportunity to contribute their thoughts

- Provide honest yet sincere feedback on areas of improvement for the group as a whole


## Unacceptable Behaviour:

- “Freeloading” from the efforts of the group and not providing meaningful contributions

- Disrespectful attitudes or remarks to members of the team or other groups within the MDS program

- Excluding members of the group from participating in team assignments and key group conversations

- Not speaking up in the case that another group member engages in unacceptable behaviour

In the case of a group member engaging in unacceptable behaviour, it is up to the other team members to speak with the particular individual ASAP before the situation escalates further. If the initial confrontation is not successful, then the group will speak with the MDS 532 lab instructor or lecturer to determine the best course of action.
