# Group 209 App

## App Description
The app’s landing page will include a two bar charts showing the top- and bottom-20 countries by percentage of consumption of a certain alcoholic drink and and a scatter plot showing relationship between the percentage of consumption of a certain alcoholic drink and the total alcohol consumption of a country. The user will be able to filter the map based on three alcoholic drinks: Beer, Wine and Spirits, and six regions: World, Asia, Europe, Americas, Africa and Oceania, using a drop-down list for each category. Once a drink and region is selected by the user, the three visualizations will update to reflect the data for the drink and region selected. The bars in the bar charts will be ordered in descending order, and the color of the bars will update based on the drink selected. The bar charts will be interactive, as by hovering over a bar, a square tooltip will appear, showing the country’s name, the proportion of the drink consumed, the total servings of the drink consumed and the country’s global and continent rank of proportion, compared to the other countries. The scatter plot will cluster the data into 4 groups: heavy drinkers that love the certain drink, heavy drinkers that love all types of alcohol, love the certain drink but not big drinkers and light drinkers that love all types of alcohol, based on values of the percentage of consumption of a certain alcoholic drink and the total alcohol consumption. The points in the scatter plot will be color coded based on the sub-region the country is in (ie Eastern Europe), if a continent is selected as the region, and based on the continent if the world is selected as the region, with a legend to the right show the color coding. The scatter plot will also be interactive,  as by hovering over a bar, a square tooltip will appear, showing the country’s name, the proportion of the drink consumed and the total servings of alcohol consumed. With the app, users will be able to discover and compare the drinking preferences of the countries of the world.
